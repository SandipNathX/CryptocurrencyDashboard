I wanted to create an application where I could check the latest prices of my favourite cryptocurrencies. I created this application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The application uses API from a price-tracking website for cryptoassets to display the cryptocurrency data. The application is 100% mobile responsive. There are other features like cryptocurrency news, cryptocurrency watchlist, link to purchase cryptocurrency.
